## 📝 Description

2048 is a single-player puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them into larger numbers. Starting with two tiles numbered 2 or 4, the objective is to merge tiles by sliding them in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right) until reaching the coveted 2048 tile. Each move generates a new tile, increasing the challenge as the grid fills up. Strategic planning and foresight are key, as players must avoid getting stuck with no valid moves left. The game ends when either the player combines tiles to create the 2048 tile or the grid fills up completely without possible merges. It captures the essence of engaging puzzle-solving while continually challenging players to beat their highest scores.
